### 📌 Project Description

This project performs *Sentiment Analysis* on customer product reviews from platforms like *Amazon* or *Flipkart. The goal is to determine whether a given review is **good* or *worst*.

It uses *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* techniques to clean and process text data, and applies a *Naive Bayes Classifier* to categorize sentiments. The project serves as an introduction to *text classification, **NLP, and **machine learning for textual data*.
